# OOAK-main
 OOAK, otherwise known as One of a Kind, is the 'brand' created by my dad as an explanation for his variety of metal creations.

 While it is not a real brand, and he does not want to market or advertize his creations, I still took some personal time to create a website for them. Along with creating something for my dad, it was also used to experiment with Grid CSS effects and gallery features. Each gallery piece has a small description and name for each creation.
